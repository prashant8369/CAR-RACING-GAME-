# CAR-RACING-GAME-
The code provided is a Python implementation of a simple car racing game using Pygame, a popular game development library in Python. The game window displays a car at the bottom of the screen, and the player can control the car to avoid collision with enemy cars coming from the top of the screen. The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases over time, and displays it on the screen. When a collision occurs or the player's car goes out of bounds, a "Game Over" message is displayed along with the developer's credits, and the game restarts after a brief pause.

The main features of the game include:

Displaying the car, enemy cars, and background road images using Pygame.
Handling user input for controlling the car using the left and right arrow keys.
Moving the enemy cars from the top of the screen to the bottom at a certain speed.
Detecting collision between the player's car and the enemy cars.
Keeping track of the player's score based on time elapsed.
Displaying a "Game Over" message and restarting the game after a collision or going out of bounds.
